techsupport_qa_ingest.py
====================================
Step 6 of the techsupport pipeline: takes a Slack thread that has already been
classified as useful + conclusive (techsupport_classifier.classify_thread) and
adds it to a new, separate "verified techsupport" content store -- incrementally,
one thread at a time. This deliberately does NOT use the drop-and-recreate
pattern that _run_update_golden_qa_pairs_task (src/main.py) uses for the
golden QA pairs -- per Dhar's instruction, this step is about nailing the
"add one row" path first.

This store is a single table/file SHARED across IDA and IDDM (and IDO),
not split per product. There is only one techsupport Slack channel
(TECHSUPPORT_CHANNEL_ID in scripts/env/techsupport_sync.env is the same
channel for all products -- see lil-lisa/app_envfiles/lil-lisa.env's
TECHSUPPORT_CHANNEL_ID_IDA/IDDM/IDO, which are all equal), and IDA/IDDM
content has real overlap, so a verified thread is useful to both bots.
There's no product classification step here at all.

Content is stored as a prose technical summary of the resolved conversation
(NOT a Question/Answer pair) plus a short generated title used as a markdown
heading -- this is blended directly into normal document retrieval
(src/agent_and_tools.py) rather than shown as a separate FAQ-style match.

*** FLAGGED OPEN ITEM for Dhar's team -- now resolved, see github_sync.py /
github_anchor.py ***
A dedicated private GitHub repo now exists for verified-techsupport content
(GITHUB_REPO_URL in scripts/env/github_push.env). Unlike the golden QA pairs
pipeline -- which treats its GitHub repo (QA_PAIRS_GITHUB_REPO_URL in
lillisa_server.env) as the source of truth, cloning it fresh on every
rebuild -- this module still treats the local markdown file under
VERIFIED_TECHSUPPORT_QA_FOLDERPATH below as the source of truth for
ingestion. The GitHub repo is a one-way push destination for
backup/visibility only: github_sync.push_verified_qa_pairs() copies the
current markdown file into a fresh clone of it and pushes, called from
nightly_pipeline.py after any add/replace.

Each entry's title is used to build a real GitHub anchor link (e.g.
".../blob/main/techsupport_qa_pairs.md#{slugified-title}", see
github_anchor.py for the slug algorithm) set into node.metadata["github_url"]
alongside "title"/"source" by insert_summary_into_lancedb() below, following
the exact same pattern src/main.py already uses for "webportal_url" --
consumed by src/agent_and_tools.py's answer_from_document_retrieval the same
way. Computing the slug requires every title in the file in order (duplicate
headings get "-1", "-2", ... suffixes, numbered by position), so
add_verified_qa_pair()/replace_verified_qa_pair() re-parse the markdown file
after writing to it and pass the freshly computed URL through -- see
_compute_github_url_for_entry(). Best-effort: any failure (e.g.
GITHUB_REPO_URL not yet configured) is caught and logged, falling back to no
github_url, since a missing link must never block the actual QA pair from
being added.

Entries added here are immediately retrievable -- there is no review/approval
gate. An expert can still optionally edit an entry's summary text directly in
the markdown file at any time; techsupport_review_sync.py picks up those edits
on the next nightly run and syncs them into LanceDB.

Also unlike techsupport_classifier.py / nightly_techsupport_sync.py, this
module DOES depend on LilLisa_Server's runtime stack (llama_index, lancedb,
voyageai) because it writes directly into the same LanceDB tables the
server's retrieval code reads from. It intentionally does NOT import
src.main (that builds the whole FastAPI app and needs far more env/setup
than ingesting one QA pair requires) -- instead it imports VoyageEmbedding
from src/embedding_config.py, a small standalone module with no FastAPI/app
dependencies that main.py itself now also imports from. Both places share
one implementation (voyage-context-3, input_type="query", 2048 dims --
confirmed against the actual IDA_QA_PAIRS/IDDM_QA_PAIRS tables' schema in the
local ./lancedb), so there's no risk of the two drifting out of sync.

Generated title/summary text is run through redact_obvious_pii() before
markdown/LanceDB/GitHub (emails, private IPs, Slack mentions, obvious
secrets, INC/SR/HD/TICKET ids, internal FQDNs). Hostnames, tenant names,
and product-specific ticket keys still need a real techsupport_qa_pairs.md
to tune -- see beads pr42-blockers.2.3. The summarize/merge prompts also
ask the model to omit that material; regex is the backstop.

Required env vars (read from ../env/lillisa_server.env, same file the main
server reads):
    LANCEDB_FOLDERPATH      - path (relative to LilLisa_Server project root) to the LanceDB folder
    VOYAGE_API_KEY_FILEPATH - path (relative to LilLisa_Server project root) to a file
                               containing the Voyage AI API key

Usage (as a library):
    from techsupport_qa_ingest import add_verified_qa_pair, generate_verified_title_and_summary
    result = add_verified_qa_pair(conversation_thread)
    preview = generate_verified_title_and_summary(conversation_thread)  # no markdown/LanceDB writes

    LanceDBVectorStore.add() (src/llama_index_lancedb_vector_store.py) already
    does exactly what "add, don't rebuild" requires: on __init__ it opens the
    table if one already exists, and add() creates the table only when

    the same way it already does for documentation nodes' webportal_url.

    Note: the table's underlying "metadata" column has a FIXED Arrow struct
    schema (established by the very first row ever written) with no
    "github_url" field -- LanceDB silently drops metadata keys that aren't in
    that fixed schema when adding rows (confirmed empirically), so
    doc.metadata["github_url"] never survives as a queryable top-level
    column. It DOES survive inside metadata["_node_content"] (a plain string
    column holding this node's full serialized state, schema-invisible to
    Arrow), which is what metadata_dict_to_node() -- used by every read path
