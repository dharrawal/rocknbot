expert_group.py
====================================
Resolves "who is an expert for product X" from a Slack user group. The user
group is the only source of expert identity: there is no single-ID setting and
no silent degradation when the group cannot be read.

Configuration (read from lil-lisa/app_envfiles/lil-lisa.env, overridable in the
process environment):
    EXPERT_GROUP_ID_IDA / _IDDM          Slack user group IDs (e.g. S0123ABCD).
                                         REQUIRED: the resolver raises if unset.
    EXPERT_GROUP_ID_IDO                  Optional -- IDO is only deployed for
                                         some workspaces. With no group, nobody
                                         is an IDO expert.
    EXPERT_GROUP_CACHE_SECONDS           Membership cache TTL (default 300).

Shared rules -- LilLisa_Server/cron/expert_group.py implements the same contract
with a blocking `requests` fetcher; keep the two aligned:
  1. Membership comes from Slack `usergroups.users.list?usergroup=<id>` and is
     cached per product for EXPERT_GROUP_CACHE_SECONDS (default 300s) so hot
     paths (every message, every reaction) do not hit Slack.
  2. On `ratelimited`, the fetch is retried once after Retry-After seconds.
  3. A required product (IDA, IDDM) with no group id is a configuration error:
     the constructor raises ValueError naming the missing variable.
  4. On a failed lookup, the last successfully cached membership keeps being
     served (its expiry is re-stamped and a warning is logged) so a brief Slack
     outage is survivable. With nothing cached, ExpertLookupError is raised so
     the failure is loud instead of silently making everyone a non-expert.
  5. An unconfigured optional product resolves to [] without any Slack call.

This module deliberately imports nothing from slack_bolt/slack_sdk: the Slack
call is injected as `fetch_members`, so tests (and the cron package) can supply
their own. A fetcher must raise `RateLimited` for Slack's `ratelimited` error to
get the retry-once behaviour.
