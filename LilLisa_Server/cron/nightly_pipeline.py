nightly_pipeline.py
====================================
End-to-end nightly techsupport pipeline, tying together the three pieces
built in earlier steps:
    1. nightly_techsupport_sync.sync() -- detect new/updated threads in the
       one shared techsupport Slack channel (TECHSUPPORT_CHANNEL_ID in
       cron/env/techsupport_sync.env; the same channel is used for IDA,
       IDDM, and IDO -- see lil-lisa/app_envfiles/lil-lisa.env's
       TECHSUPPORT_CHANNEL_ID_IDA/IDDM/IDO, which are all equal).
    2. techsupport_classifier.classify_thread() -- classify each changed
       thread as useful / conclusive.
    3. techsupport_qa_ingest.add_verified_qa_pair() -- for threads that are
       both useful and conclusive, extract a Q&A pair and add it to the
       single shared verified-techsupport store (product-agnostic; there is
       no per-product classification step). Entries are retrievable
       immediately -- there is no expert-review gate.

Each thread is processed independently (its own try/except) so one bad
thread can't take down the whole run. A per-run summary is logged, and if
any thread errored, the error details are posted to the shared admin Slack
channel (ADMIN_CHANNEL_ID in cron/env/techsupport_sync.env -- reuses the
same channel lil-lisa's ADMIN_CHANNEL_ID_IDA/ADMIN_CHANNEL_ID_IDDM already
point at).

How often step 1 actually checks the Slack channel is itself interval-gated
by TECHSUPPORT_SYNC_INTERVAL_HOURS (env/lillisa_server.env, default 24, i.e.
once a day) -- is_channel_check_due() below checks elapsed time since the
last check (tracked in techsupport_sync_state.json's last_run_timestamp,
which nightly_techsupport_sync.sync() already maintains) and skips calling
sync() entirely if the interval hasn't elapsed, the same
"check-elapsed-time-skip-if-not-due" pattern
techsupport_contextual_reembed.is_reembed_due() uses. This is independent of
TECHSUPPORT_REEMBED_INTERVAL_DAYS below, which controls how often the
contextual re-embed runs, not how often the channel gets checked.

Dedup: whether a thread has already been added to the verified DB is tracked
in techsupport_sync_state.json (the same per-thread state file
nightly_techsupport_sync.py already maintains for last_seen_reply_ts), via an
"added_to_verified_db": true field. A thread is only marked this way AFTER
add_verified_qa_pair() returns successfully, and the flag is saved to disk
immediately (not batched until the end of the run) so a crash partway through
a run doesn't lose track of threads that were already added -- a retry will
correctly skip those and only reconsider threads that weren't marked.

An already-added thread is only ever reconsidered when sync() itself detects
new reply activity on it (i.e. it shows up in updated_thread_ids); a thread
with no new activity is never touched, added_to_verified_db=true or not. When
one IS reconsidered, it is re-classified against the complete, current
conversation. If still useful+conclusive, the existing verified entry is
REPLACED in place (full regeneration from the whole updated conversation,
old entry fully discarded) -- see process_thread()'s already_added branch and
techsupport_qa_ingest.replace_verified_qa_pair(). If no longer useful or
conclusive, the existing entry is deliberately left as-is rather than
removed, since a changed classification isn't evidence the old answer became
wrong. Replacement relies on the entry's source thread_ts having been
recorded when it was added (techsupport_review_state.json); entries added
before that tracking existed can't be located and are left untouched, logged
as an error for that thread rather than silently skipped.

A separate pass, run_product_channel_pass(), runs after the techsupport loop
and before the GitHub push: the product channels (PRODUCT_CHANNEL_ID_IDA /
_IDDM / _IDO in cron/env/techsupport_sync.env) are scanned for threads where a
member of that product's expert user group replied to a Lil Lisa answer. A
thread with no expert reply never reaches an LLM call. When the answer in that
thread cited a verified entry (recorded at answer time by invoke(), read back
via get_cited_entry_title), the expert's reply SUPERSEDES that entry
(correct_verified_entry); otherwise a useful+conclusive thread is added like
any other. The pass shares this run's error list, admin alert, GitHub push and
index reload, is gated per channel by TECHSUPPORT_SYNC_INTERVAL_HOURS, capped
by PRODUCT_SCAN_MAX_THREADS_PER_RUN, and turned off entirely by
TECHSUPPORT_SCAN_PRODUCT_CHANNELS=false (env/lillisa_server.env). The
hot/catch-up windows nightly_techsupport_sync.py applies (TECHSUPPORT_SYNC_HOT_DAYS,
TECHSUPPORT_SYNC_CATCHUP_AGE_DAYS, TECHSUPPORT_SYNC_CATCHUP_INTERVAL_DAYS) are
per channel, so they govern each product channel exactly as they govern the
techsupport channel. The very first scan of a product channel is additionally
bounded by PRODUCT_SCAN_INITIAL_LOOKBACK_DAYS (default 30): a channel with no
state would otherwise be synced from timestamp 0, i.e. its entire history, so
the pass seeds that channel's last_run_timestamp to now minus the lookback
before the first sync() call. The techsupport channel is untouched by this.

run_product_channel_scan() runs the product pass on its own, without the
techsupport loop, the review sync or the re-embed, and is what POST
/run_product_channel_scan/ triggers (see src/techsupport_cron.py). It still
does the GitHub push and index reload when the pass changed something, and
force=True makes it ignore the per-channel interval gate.

A fourth, less-frequent piece also runs at the end of every invocation:
techsupport_contextual_reembed.run_if_due() -- a periodic full re-embed of
the TECHSUPPORT_QA_PAIRS table using Voyage's contextual embedding (whole
techsupport_qa_pairs.md as one document, so every entry benefits from
full-document context, not just what existed when it was individually
added). It only actually re-embeds once every TECHSUPPORT_REEMBED_INTERVAL_DAYS
(env/lillisa_server.env, default 7); otherwise it no-ops. Keeping this call
here instead of a separate cron entry keeps all techsupport operations
consolidated into the one nightly script.

A fifth piece, techsupport_review_sync.sync_edited_entries(), runs after every
invocation too: it picks up any markdown entries an expert has since edited
directly (see techsupport_review_sync.py) and syncs the current text into
LanceDB. This is purely optional/best-effort -- there is no gating tied to it.

A sixth piece, github_sync.push_verified_qa_pairs() (see FLAGGED OPEN ITEM in
techsupport_qa_ingest.py), pushes techsupport_qa_pairs.md to a dedicated
private GitHub repo (GITHUB_TOKEN / GITHUB_REPO_URL in
cron/env/github_push.env) -- but only when this run actually added,
enriched, or replaced an entry (counts["added"] or counts["enriched"] or
counts["replaced"]), since that's the only way the markdown file's content
changes. push_verified_qa_pairs() itself
also no-ops if the file turns out to be byte-identical to what's already in
the repo, so this is a double-safe skip against pushing empty commits.

Scheduling: the API process runs this on its own tick, via
LilLisa_Server/src/techsupport_cron.py -- there is no crontab. POST
/run_nightly_pipeline/ forces a full run against a live server, and POST
/run_product_channel_scan/ forces just the product-channel pass.

Usage (manual/debugging only; don't run this while the API is up, since the
in-process lock cannot see a second OS process):

    has_expert_insight() is the second: an expert did reply, but the reply only
    asks a question, requests clarification, or is small talk, so there is
    nothing to fold into the knowledge base and the thread is left alone as
    "skipped_no_expert_insight". Nothing is written and no flag is set, so the
    thread is reconsidered automatically the next time sync() sees new reply
    activity on it -- which is the point: the expert's later correction is
    picked up on the run after it is posted.
