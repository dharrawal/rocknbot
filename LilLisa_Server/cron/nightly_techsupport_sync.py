"""
nightly_techsupport_sync.py
====================================
Standalone script (no dependency on LilLisa_Server or lil-lisa's runtime code)
that detects which threads in a Slack techsupport channel are new or have new
reply activity since the last run.

Slack's conversations.history only returns new top-level messages (filtered by
an "oldest" timestamp) -- it does NOT surface new replies posted to existing
threads. Slack has no "threads updated since T" API; parent messages do carry
latest_reply when you fetch the parent itself.

Detection therefore:
  1. Finds new parents via conversations.history(oldest=last_run) and stores
     each message's latest_reply (no extra call).
  2. Refreshes latest_reply on a bounded set of already-known threads by
     fetching the parent only (conversations.history, inclusive, limit=1) --
     never conversations.replies. Nightly: threads whose last_seen_reply_ts
     is within TECHSUPPORT_SYNC_HOT_DAYS (default 30). Periodic catch-up:
     threads within TECHSUPPORT_SYNC_CATCHUP_AGE_DAYS (default 90). Both
     lists are capped at TECHSUPPORT_SYNC_MAX_PARENT_LOOKUPS. Threads quieter
     than the catch-up age cap are not polled (state is kept, including
     added_to_verified_db). The pipeline fetches full replies later, and only
     for new/updated ids.

This is step one of the nightly techsupport sync job: it only detects new /
updated threads. Classifying threads as resolved (or anything else) is a
separate, later step.

sync() is channel-parametric: sync() with no argument syncs
TECHSUPPORT_CHANNEL_ID (the historical behaviour nightly_pipeline.py's
techsupport loop relies on), sync(channel_id=...) syncs any other channel --
used by nightly_pipeline.py's product-channel pass (PRODUCT_CHANNEL_ID_IDA /
_IDDM / _IDO), which looks for expert corrections in the IDA/IDDM/IDO
channels. State is therefore keyed by channel:

    {"version": 2,
     "channels": {"<channel id>": {"last_run_timestamp": ...,
                                   "last_catchup_timestamp": ...,
                                   "threads": {...}}}}

load_state() accepts only this shape. A missing file starts a fresh v2
state; an existing file whose top-level "version" is not 2 (including the
pre-version-2 flat shape, which had last_run_timestamp /
last_catchup_timestamp / threads at the top level) raises RuntimeError
naming the path, so the run stops instead of silently starting over. The
operator deletes the file and re-runs; nothing shipped has the old shape.

Required env vars (see ./env/techsupport_sync.env):
    SLACK_BOT_TOKEN        - Slack bot token with channels:history / groups:history
                              (and the read scope for the channel type in use)
    TECHSUPPORT_CHANNEL_ID - Channel ID to sync (e.g. the test-techsupport channel)

Optional (see ./env/techsupport_sync.env):
    PRODUCT_CHANNEL_ID_IDA / _IDDM / _IDO - product channels scanned for expert
                              corrections; a missing one disables that product.
    LIL_LISA_SLACK_USERID   - the bot's Slack user id, used to role-tag its turns.

Optional knobs (env/lillisa_server.env, overridable in the process environment):
    TECHSUPPORT_SYNC_HOT_DAYS                - nightly parent-lookup window (default 30)
    TECHSUPPORT_SYNC_CATCHUP_AGE_DAYS        - catch-up age cap (default 90)
    TECHSUPPORT_SYNC_CATCHUP_INTERVAL_DAYS   - how often catch-up runs (default 7)
    TECHSUPPORT_SYNC_MAX_PARENT_LOOKUPS      - cap per lookup set (default 200)
